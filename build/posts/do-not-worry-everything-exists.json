However...</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-all-about-the-context\">It&#39;s All About the Context</h3>\n<p>Words are fuzzy patterns. A word in different situations has a different meaning. A word has different meanings between speaker &amp; listener.</p>\n<p>Adding context gives precise meaning. An atheist can accurately say; God does not exist in my belief system or I don&#39;t believe in God; denying the need for God, yet having compassion for someone else&#39;s belief system. Religious believers can have compassion for all nonbelievers, as there are many interdependent tribes on Earth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"everything-is-governed-by-nature\">Everything is Governed by Nature</h3>\n<p>The nature of Physical &amp; Conceptual Existence follows behaviour that we can study using the arts (spirituality included) &amp; sciences. Supernatural phenomena is caused by unknown Natural Law.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-nature-of-god-is-defined-by-each-person\">The Nature of God is Defined by each Person</h3>\n<p>God is a concept, who&#39;s meaning is as individual as the person who hold it.</p>\n<p>God, to me, is Existence (conceptual &amp; physical). Every person has a belief system. The simple abstraction of the belief system is the God, even if we don&#39;t call it God.</p>\n<p>God involves creation. Our feelings, thoughts, &amp; actions create God; We can create God the jealous, wrathful, &amp; cruel; We can create God the loving, compassionate, &amp; nurturing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-need-for-exoteric-religion\">The Need for Exoteric Religion?</h3>\n<p>A person&#39;s belief system influences the person&#39;s thoughts, actions, &amp; interpretations.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoteric\" target=\"_blank\">Exoteric Religions</a> impose a belief system composed of some outdated traditions. There are unifying ethics that create harmony with self &amp; others, however these ethics can be taught without Exoteric Religion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-nature--calling\">Our Nature &amp; Calling</h3>\n<p>Having compassion for ourselves &amp; each other connects us in harmonious interdependence. A symbiotic spiral of evolving intelligence, love, dignity.</p>\n<p>When we love, respect, &amp; have compassion for ourselves &amp; each other, we live.</p>\n","metadata":{"title":"Do Not Worry, Everything Exists","author":"Brian Takita","date":"1/3/15 3:45","description":"Does God exist?
