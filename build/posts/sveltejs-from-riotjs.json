That&#39;s because, Svelte JS generates optimal javascript while not having the overhead of a runtime library. It&#39;s also going to have an advantage in page load time due to not requiring a runtime library to be loaded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"html-based-components\">HTML-based Components</h2>\n<p>HTML is the lingua franca of the world wide web. HTML the lowest common denominator (developers, designers, non-technical) can work with. With Svelte, the HTML file is converted to be a Component. Components can use other Components.</p>\n<p>I feel confident that I will continue to use Svelte for a long time. Since it&#39;s design is simple &amp; well thought out (all of my use cases were supported with elegance), I don&#39;t expect to have upgrade pains that plague some of the larger frameworks out there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apis\">APIs</h2>\n<p>Svelte&#39;s api idioms are well thought out. Development flow was coherent natural during the port from Riot.</p>\n<p>For each of my professional clients, I use a monorepo using the <a href=\"https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core\" target=\"_blank\">ctx-core</a> toolkit. ctx-core has supporting architecture of a dependency injected ctx (context), agents, &amp; build tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-component\">Example Component</h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example component (Dossier__Search). It is composed of a search box, search results, &amp; the detail of the selected person.</p>\n<p>On the top is the html of the component &amp; below is the javascript behavior.</p>\n<p>This example highlights the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>properties</li>\n<li>computed properties</li>\n<li>helpers</li>\n<li>methods</li>\n<li>two-way binding</li>\n<li>sub components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/guide\" target=\"_blank\">read more about the features of svelte</a>.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/btakita/786d35c18f001908c59194a8cbfe637c.js\"></script>","metadata":{"title":"Svelte JS from Riot JS","author":"Brian Takita","date":"07/03/17 20:30","intro":"<p>Creating Web Components/Web Apps has never been more pleasurable.\nIt&#39;s out with the old &amp; in with the new.
