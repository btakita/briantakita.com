These initiatives take land off of the market, which hurts people who do not have wealth, because land, home, &amp; rent prices are driven up. Effectively, the people have less housing at a higher price. This in turn increases homelessness &amp; social instability. Bad deal for the US, or any other sovereign nation.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change\" target=\"_blank\">UNFCCC</a>, we see &quot;sustainable&quot; initiatives such as &quot;<a href=\"http://americandreamcoalition.org/?page_id=3299\" target=\"_blank\">stack &amp; pack housing</a>&quot;. <a href=\"https://nihrecord.nih.gov/newsletters/2008/07_25_2008/story1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Experiments</a> have been done on crowding people together.

Even if this is not the intention, we need to be vigilant against the possibility that Entities wish to undermine US sovereignty through various means, obvious &amp; non-obvious.</p>\n<p>Notice that Trump also pulled out of the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/23/trump-signs-executive-order-withdrawing-us-from-tpp-trade-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">TPP</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/27/trump-agrees-to-renegotiate-nafta-with-canada-mexico-leaders.html\" target=\"_blank\">NAFTA</a>. These are multi-lateral agreements that reek of global governance. Instead, we need to only have bi-lateral agreements with other nations, to keep the integrity of US sovereignty.
