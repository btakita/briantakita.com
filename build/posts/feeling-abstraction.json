Something feeling hot means Heat (Energy) is transferred to your body from that thing; something feeling cold means Heat is transferred from your body to that thing.</p>\n<p>A simple connection can lead to analogies in similar abstract structures. Like I felt a hot response from her as her attention poured on me; or she seemed cold to my attention.</p>\n<p>Humans create mental models, called abstractions; Whether the abstraction is a word, symbol, picture, a feeling, etc. The identity of that abstraction can be expressed as an explicit title with defined lines, or a fuzzy feeling that is vague and difficult to identify.</p>\n<p>As you focus on an abstraction, observe your feelings; like how you observe a room. Move attention from one spot to another. Flow, zoom in &amp; out. Let the abstractions flow in &amp; out of focus.</p>\n<p>Feel the abstractions around you. Perhaps you can even touch an abstraction. Don&#39;t worry about not being able to name the abstractions or even knowing exactly what is there. Our visual &amp; spatial awareness is a flowing interaction with the environment. Nothing needs to be name when observing.</p>\n<p>And yet, naming something creates a new abstraction. This allows new analogies &amp; systems to be created. New rooms to explore. New things to feel.</p>\n","metadata":{"title":"Feeling Abstraction","author":"Brian Takita","date":"1/17/15 20:00","description":"Reductionist mechanisms in Physical Existence are Energy & Energy Transfer.
