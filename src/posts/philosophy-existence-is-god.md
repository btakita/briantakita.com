Philosophies are conceptual models. Conceptual models have a domain language. If we expand the scope of certain definitions, we have the ability to expand consciousness. If we are able to make more associations between concepts, consciousness expands.

I'm evolving a <a href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy" target="_blank">philosophy</a> that has it's own <a href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy/blob/master/src/domain-driven-design.md" target="_blank">domain language</a>. The domain language is similar to their common cultural definitions, however I expand the scope of these words. Expanding the scope of these words enables conceptual patterns to be reused across different scopes in <a href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy/blob/master/src/existence.md" target="_blank">Existence</a>.

I'm happy to utilize, and prove, <a href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy/blob/master/src/god.md" target="_blank">God's</a> existence. Since Existence is God and Existence, well exists, God Exists in this Philosophy.

While there has been some critique on Ann Rand's statement "Existence Exists", <a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2014/01/does-existence-exist.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2011/05/ayn-rand-on-existence-exists.html" target="_blank">critiques</a> are based on a limited definition of Exists as to meaning physical existence. The "Existence is God" Philosophy defines existence as "Everything that 'is', or more simply, everything". That includes all thoughts ever thought, all possible concepts, including the notion of Existence being everything. Thus Existence Exists.

I enjoy speaking to <a href="https://github.com/btakita/philosophy/blob/master/src/atheism.md" target="_blank">atheists</a> because ideas from atheism led to me expanding the scope of God. Also, atheists tend to be skeptical toward dogmas, which leads to further exploration. This exploration expands consciousness, which I have as one of my primary life goals.

If you wish to explore some of these concepts with me, please contact me or leave a comment!
