Language is used by humans to communicate & influence how humans think. Language sets the boundaries of human thought & communication. Words are abstractions, and can represent anything. We are all magicians, casting spells of anything imaginable with our words.

Language is also used by all life & ultimately, all entities. Language has evolved with life, becoming more flexible & nuanced.

Words are patterns. We tend to think of words as fixed entities, however words are combinable with other words to form context. The meaning & experiences associated with a word depend on the context of the sentence. Other words influence the focused meaning of the word.

## The Existence of Pippin

Existence includes Physical Existence and Conceptual Existence. A cat can be any cat, but Pippin is the cat that I hang out with. I have stories about Pippin. Pippin has a distinct personality. Unless you personally know Pippin, those phrases only have an abstract meaning, because I am merely expressing my interpretation of Pippin.

When one personifies an Entity, then the Abstraction of the Entity comes to life. When I walk around the house, Pippin joins me. He runs around & inspires play. Pippin has a wild eyed expression on his face, inviting me to play. He expresses the want for attention. He yearns to co-evolve with me.

## Life in Words, Abstractions, Meanings

Culture also implicitly scopes words.

## Naughty Words Become Obsolete

Our language is stuck in the past; which introduces misunderstandings, wastes energy, & misleads people.
