<b>Motivation</b>

<p>
	After maintaining several applications, I ran into the issues of:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>quickly creating & iterating on features</li>
	<li>extracting code to reuse</li>
	<li>time to refactor code</li>
	<li>time to upgrade software</li>
	<li>gluing together small libraries & snippets</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Using existing solutions such as frameworks or libraries provides the benefit of quickly getting started,
		however there is a maintenance burden of:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>large payload size & memory usage</li>
	<li>extending the underlying software to fulfill requirements</li>
	<li>time to upgrade the application with the underlying libraries</li>
	<li>domain language mismatch between the library/framework</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I found that there are usually small libraries & code snippets that can be glued together
		with a <A href="/posts/naming-conventions">naming convention</A> that utilizes unique, immutable, & composable names.
	As a result, one could find all usages of an entity or concept by doing a project-wide search.
	Rename refactorings were more accurate & comprehensive due to the uniqueness of names.
	Composable naming allows one to understand the context & full description of the entity.
