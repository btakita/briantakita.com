The wonderful web makes it very easy for someone to publish their thoughts and opinions, good and bad, true and false. If you find yourself at the wrong end of a post that shows up in your Google results, the implications can be very damaging. It ceases to be a matter of truth, but a matter of marketing.

Fortunately, you can take control over your name on the web, without having to spend thousands of dollars that online reputation repair firms charge.

<a href="http://brandyourself.com" target="_blank">Brandyourself.com</a> makes it easy to inexpensively control your SEO destiny. Here is my <a href="http://briantakita.brandyourself.com/" target="_blank">profile</a>.

Their free plan has a limitation of setting up three links for the free plan, so I bought their "Premium Membership" giving me unlimited links for $9 every 3 months. This should give me an initial bump. Since I just acquired <a href="http://www.briantakita.com" target="_blank">briantakita.com</a>, I can transfer the links to my blog after the 3 months.

Now I sit back and wait for Google to index the results :-)
