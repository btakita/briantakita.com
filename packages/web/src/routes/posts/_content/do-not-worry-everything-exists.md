Does God exist? Surely, Santa Claus & Unicorns do not exist. Yet we are talking about them. If they don't exist, why & how am I talking about them?

Santa Claus & Unicorns do exist, as fictional characters; more on God later. Everything Exists. The concept conceptually exists. It may also physically exist; like the men who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/23/real-santas_n_6366974.html" target="_blank">name themselves Santa Claus</a>.

Surely this must be a cheat; Some sort of sleight of hand; Missing the point. However...

### It's All About the Context

Words are fuzzy patterns. A word in different situations has a different meaning. A word has different meanings between speaker & listener.

Adding context gives precise meaning. An atheist can accurately say; God does not exist in my belief system or I don't believe in God; denying the need for God, yet having compassion for someone else's belief system. Religious believers can have compassion for all nonbelievers, as there are many interdependent tribes on Earth.

### Everything is Governed by Nature

The nature of Physical & Conceptual Existence follows behaviour that we can study using the arts (spirituality included) & sciences. Supernatural phenomena is caused by unknown Natural Law.

### The Nature of God is Defined by each Person

God is a concept, who's meaning is as individual as the person who hold it.

God, to me, is Existence (conceptual & physical). Every person has a belief system. The simple abstraction of the belief system is the God, even if we don't call it God.

God involves creation. Our feelings, thoughts, & actions create God; We can create God the jealous, wrathful, & cruel; We can create God the loving, compassionate, & nurturing.

### The Need for Exoteric Religion?

A person's belief system influences the person's thoughts, actions, & interpretations.

Some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoteric" target="_blank">Exoteric Religions</a> impose a belief system composed of some outdated traditions. There are unifying ethics that create harmony with self & others, however these ethics can be taught without Exoteric Religion.

### Our Nature & Calling

Having compassion for ourselves & each other connects us in harmonious interdependence. A symbiotic spiral of evolving intelligence, love, dignity.

When we love, respect, & have compassion for ourselves & each other, we live.
