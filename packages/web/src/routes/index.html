<h2>What to put on the Homepage?</h2>

<p>
	I'm redesigning my site. I will be posting ideas, news, etc.
	This will be my microblog, which I will <a href="/archive">archive</a>.
	My <a href="/blog">blog</a> will contain longer articles.
	This site is also a proof-of-concept, eat your own dogfood of a person-centric "social network" profile.
	While I'm working on making this process smooth for me, as a programmer,
		I would also like to extend this experience for non-programmers.
	I believe there are certain workflows that are productive & encourage flow of expression
		for people with or without technical persuasion.

<h3>Holochain</h3>

<p>
	Lately, I have been turned onto <a href="https://holochain.org/">Holochain</a>.
	Thank you to <a href="https://medium.com/@sunyatax" target="_blank">Eric Yang</a>,
		founder of <a href="https://holo.host/project/junto/">Junto</a> for introducing me to this technology.
</p>

<p>I've read through:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/blob/whitepaper/holochain.pdf">Holochain Whitepaper</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf">Holo Currency Paper</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://files.holo.host/2018/03/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf">Holo Green Paper</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
	I encourage you to read these papers,
		as they explain the state of distributed networks & the innovations
		that Holochain & the Holo currency bring.
