```js exec route
	import A from '@ctx-core/a__target/A__Target.svelte'
```

I wrote
	<A href="/posts/tag-graph-naming-convention">
		Tag Graph Naming Convention
	</A>
	which is a 1 dimensional Graph of Tags that can be used to name
	abstractions, such as variables, functions, data structures, apis,
	or even be used in text.

I also have a previous post with a quick introduction to the
	<A href="/posts/naming-conventions">
		Naming Conventions
	</A>.
