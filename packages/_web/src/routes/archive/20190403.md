This is my microblog, where I will be posting ideas, news, etc.
It is <A href="/archive">archived</A>.
There is also a <A href="/blog">blog</A> which contains longer articles.

Here's the <A href="https://github.com/btakita/briantakita.com">source code</A> for this site.

### Naming Conventions

I've been experimenting & making progress with <A href="/posts/naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</A>.
Naming conventions for immutable entities has proven to reduce incidental complexity.
I'm working on fleshing out the last details & a whitepaper. Please stay tuned.
This practice has helped me remove incidental complexity from my codebases.

### Svelte

I'm also a fan of <A href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</A> &
	<A href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</A>.
Svelte is provides truly reactive stores & html components.
Html components mean it's easy for programmers & non-programmers (e.g. designers) to work with.
Svelte is compiled, resulting in a payload that is small, fast, & memory efficient.

### Holochain

I'm also a fan of <A href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte (v3)</A> &
	<A href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</A>.
Svelte is provides truly reactive stores & html components.
Html components mean it's easy for programmers & non-programmers (e.g. designers) to work with.
Svelte is compiled, resulting in a payload that is small, fast, & memory efficient.

I've read through:

* <A href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/blob/whitepaper/holochain.pdf">Holochain Whitepaper</A>
* <A href="https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf">Holo Currency Paper</A>
* <A href="https://files.holo.host/2018/03/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf">Holo Green Paper</A>

I encourage you to read these papers,
	as they explain the state of distributed networks & the innovations
	that Holochain & the Holo currency bring.
